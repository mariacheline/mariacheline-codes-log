**Today's Progress:** Started learning BEM (Block__Element--Modifier)

**Thoughts:** Not long ago, I started looking into modular CSS and the most suggested ones were OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM. I mostly tried looking into the first two that were mentioned because once I saw the ugly-omg-classes-everywhere structure of BEM, I just disregarded it. Unfortunately, I got a little bit perplexed about the first two so, again, I gave BEM a try. So I started reading articles and feedbacks about it and the more I read about it, the more I got excited about how simple yet powerful it actually is, especially when you're working in a team---since BEM has a pretty declarative syntax.

I'm currently working on a small project and I'm implementing BEM on it. I have yet to wrap my head around it and practice as I'm still confused about some stuff.
All in all, I'm pretty excited about it.

**Today's Progress:** Getting started with Bourbon, a SASS mixin library

**Thoughts:** Until now, I have only been writing my stylesheet from scratch. I know right? Why don't I just use bootstrap, it's easier? I didn't like bootstrap for how unsemantic it seemed to me (I'm still planning on getting into bootstrap because version 4 sounds interesting to me) and that's why I chose Bourbon, specifically Neat. Neat provides semantic grids, unlike those frameworks where you have to add classes everywhere for you to style your html. Another thing is i'm using BEM so I want my html to be as "less confusing" as possible.

To be honest, I was confused on the usage of such framework. When I looked into the docs, mostly everything in the library was deprecated (You'll find explanations [here](http://bourbon.netlify.com/)) and only few remained, so I asked myself why should I use such thing if I could just code them myself? But then again, it's a framework, it's supposed to make your work faster so, I guess, I got nothing to lose.
So far i'm finding it useful. I have yet to try Bitters and Refills.

post scriptum: I like the tint and shade functions.

**Today's Progress:** Mobile First Approach and Adobe XD

**Thoughts:** I have only been designing using the desktop first approach until recently I was having some complications with coding the responsive design of a recent project. I figured out maybe I should try some other approach and that approach is the mobile first approach. So I deleted all my SASS files and started from scratch but before that I tried designing the project using Adobe XD, still starting from mobile and up.
I was amazed on how fast I implemented the design into my code. Also Adobe XD might be my best "go-to" when designing a website. I almost wanted a Mac so I could use Sketch, which is only available on Mac (I guess for now? I'm not sure), however I came across Adobe XD and so far it's really nice and fast to work on. It's still in beta so there's still some things that are buggy or missing but I'm looking forward to it.
