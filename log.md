**Today's Progress:** Started learning BEM (Block__Element--Modifier)

**Thoughts:** Not long ago, I started looking into modular CSS and the most suggested ones were OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM. I mostly tried looking into the first two that were mentioned because once I saw the ugly-omg-classes-everywhere structure of BEM, I just disregarded it. Unfortunately, I got a little bit perplexed about the first two so, again, I gave BEM a try. So I started reading articles and feedbacks about it and the more I read about it, the more I got excited about how simple yet powerful it actually is, especially when you're working in a team---since BEM has a pretty declarative syntax.

I'm currently working on a small project and I'm implementing BEM on it. I have yet to wrap my head around it and practice as I'm still confused about some stuff.
All in all, I'm pretty excited about it.

**Today's Progress:** Getting started with Bourbon, a SASS framework


**Thoughts:** Until now, I have only been writing my stylesheet from scratch. I know right? Why don't I just use bootstrap, it's easier? I didn't like bootstrap for how unsemantic it seemed to me (I'm still planning on getting into bootstrap because version 4 sounds interesting to me) and that's why I chose Bourbon, specifically Neat. Neat provides semantic grids, unlike those frameworks where you have to add classes everywhere for you to style your html. Another thing is i'm using BEM so I want my html to be as "less confusing" as possible.

To be honest, I was confused on the usage of such framework. When I looked into the docs, mostly everything in the library was deprecated (You'll find explanations [here](http://bourbon.netlify.com/)) and only few remained, so I asked myself why should I use such thing if I could just code them myself? But then again, it's a framework, it's supposed to make your work faster so, I guess, I got nothing to lose.
So far i'm finding it useful. I have yet to try Bitters and Refills.

post scriptum: I like the tint and shade functions.
