**Today's Progress**: Started learning BEM (Block__Element--Modifier)

**Thoughts**: Not long ago, I started looking into modular CSS and the most suggested ones were OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM. I mostly tried looking into the first two that were mentioned because once I saw the ugly-omg-classes-everywhere structure of BEM, I just disregarded it. Unfortunately, I got a little bit perplexed about the first two so, again, I gave BEM a try. So I started reading articles and feedbacks about it and the more I read about it, the more I got excited about how simple yet powerful it actually is, especially when you're working in a team---since BEM has a pretty declarative syntax.

I'm currently working on a small project and i'm implementing BEM on it. I have yet to wrap my head around it and practice as I'm still confused about some stuff.
All in all, i'm pretty excited about it.
