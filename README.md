# mariacheline coding - log

This log is inspired by [100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) from FreeCodeCamp.

I thought it's fun to keep track of my improvements as I teach myself web development (front-end mostly). Although I'm not really gonna follow the [rules](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md), i'll still follow the [structure](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) of the log.


Here I go, let's learn some stuff!
